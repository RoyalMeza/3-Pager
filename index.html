	<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
	<p>So what I think may be cool about me is having a lot of pets. I have 4 cats, 10 dogs, and 1 turtle. I love them all because they all love me and I can spend time with them when I feel I am struggling with something and stressed especially with school. I think it's cool because there isn't anything I can think of about me that makes me cool.There are even times when Hummingbirds come around and we give them nectar in feeders. We make boxes around the the house and yard for birds to make nests there and we get to see them once in a while until they leave then more birds come. I'd say being able to interact with so many animals like I can understand them is wonderful and makes me cool.</p>

	<p>What also makes me cool is being able to put stuff like "Qui autem tempora quas sit recusandae unde quae, doloremque eaque voluptate ut amet eos esse obcaecati modi voluptates hic nihil?" into here when I don't want to say anything else. I am a huge game addict and I feel I can be able to have fun or be able to release tension from being stressed about things or if I just want to let go I can. Same goes for music, I listen to a variety but some kinds of music I can't seem to find so I stick to a few kinds of music, but it also keeps me relaxed or pumped or "in the feels", however I feel or need to feel I will play the music for it.</p>
